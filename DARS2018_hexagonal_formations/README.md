# Hexagonal formations for resilient consensus 
## _Distributed Autonomous Robotic Systems - DARS 2018_

### Abstract
Achieving consensus in distributed robot networks is a challenging task when the network contains non-cooperative robots. The conditions of robustness in communication networks are very restrictive and difficult to adapt to robot networks where the communication links are based on proximity. In this paper, we present a new topology network that is suitable for triangular lattices. We introduce sufficient conditions on hexagonal formations to offer resilience up to F non-cooperative robots. Using our framework, a resilient backbone can be designed to connect multiple points or to cover a given area while maintaining a robust communication network. We show theoretical guarantees for our proposed hexagonal formation and its variations. Different scenarios in simulations are presented to validate our approach.
